## Contributing new features or bug fixes

Please send a GitHub [Pull
Request](https://github.com/memgraph/helm-charts/pulls) with a clear list of what
you've done. Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

There are two main types of contributions:
1. **Bug fixes**
2. **New features**

Both types of fixes should be applied to the `release` branch, that is currently active based on the upcoming [milestone](https://github.com/memgraph/helm-charts/milestone/2) for example `release-0.1.3` branch.

In order for a pull request to be merged, a review by two code owners is required and the tests need to pass remotely.
