Thank you for installing the Memgraph High-availability cluster! ðŸŽ‰

Memgraph HA cluster includes 3 coordinators, 2 data instances by default. The cluster setup is performed via the cluster-setup job. The HA cluster is still work in progress and started with "--experimental-enabled=high-availability".
The cluster is started in the configuration without the node selector, which means that in the current configuration, it is not highly available if the node fails.

The cluster setup requires the proper enterprise license to work since HA is an enterprise feature.

You can connect to Memgraph instances via Lab, mgconsole, or any other client. By default, all Memgraph instances (coordinators and data instances) listen on port 7687 for a bolt connection.
Make sure your are connecting to the correct ip address and port. For details check the configuration on your cloud provider(aws, gcp, azure, etc.)

If you are connecting via mgconsole, you can use the following command:

mgconsole --host <your-instance-ip> --port <your-instance-port>

If you are connecting via Lab, specify your instance IP address and port in Memgraph Lab GUI.

If you are using minikube, you can find out your instance ip using `minikube ip`.
