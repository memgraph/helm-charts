Thank you for installing Memgraph! ðŸŽ‰

Connect to Memgraph via Lab, mgconsole, or any other client to your Memgraph instance. By default Memgraph listens on port 7687 for a bolt connection inside the cluster.
Make sure your are connecting to the correct ip address of your instance. For details check the configuration on your cloud provider(aws, gcp, azure, etc.)

Important notes
- always fix the Memgraph image tag to a specific version. Setting the image tag to "latest" can trigger automatic upgrades on pod restarts in some cases combined with respective pullPolicy of the image.
- check the requested and maximum limits of memory. Setting Memgraph's flag --memory-limit to an amount that is less to the maximum amount your pod has been given can trigger pod restarts because of preemptive eviction

If you are connecting via mgconsole, you can use the following command:

mgconsole --host <your-instance-ip> --port <your-instance-port>

If you are connecting via Lab, specify your instance ip address and port in Memgraph Lab GUI.
