Thank you for installing Memgraph! 🎉

Connect to Memgraph via Lab, mgconsole, or any other client to your Memgraph instance. By default Memgraph listens on port 7687 for a bolt connection inside the cluster.
Make sure your are connecting to the correct ip address of your instance. For details check the configuration on your cloud provider(aws, gcp, azure, etc.)

If you are connecting via mgconsole, you can use the following command:

mgconsole --host <your-instance-ip> --port <your-instance-port> --username <your-username> --password <your-password>

If you are connecting via Lab, specify your instance ip address and port in Memgraph Lab GUI.
